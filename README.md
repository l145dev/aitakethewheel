# AI take the wheel (aitakethewheel)

**AI Take The Wheel** is a web app that lets AI generate creative, uncommon web apps for you instantly! Powered by [Groq](https://groq.com/) and OpenAI's "openai/gpt-oss-120b" model, this project demonstrates how AI can take over the wheel and build unique HTML/CSS web apps on demand.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Generated Web Apps:**  
  Each time you click "Generate AI Code," the app asks an AI model to create a new, uncommon web app using only plain HTML and inline CSS.
- **Instant Preview:**  
  The generated code is rendered live in the browser, letting you see the AI's creation immediately.
- **Modern Stack:**  
  Built with [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and TypeScript.

## üöÄ Getting Started
